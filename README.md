# Responsive Portfolio

## Task

For this project, we design a web application based on Responsive design. Incorporating this design will allow us to render our web application on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

## Files

The files used for this task are as follow:

For HTML:
* `index.html`
* `portfolio.html`
* `contact.html`

For CSS:
* `contactStyle.css`
* `indexStyle.css`
* `portfolio.css`

## Resposive design and Behavior
The end goal is to make a web application where the design responds to the user's behavior and environment. One way to incorporate this design is to use responsive CSS grid systems and layouts with the use of media queries. For this task, we use the Bootstrap framework, to build responsive, mobile-first web application and customize to fit our needs.
